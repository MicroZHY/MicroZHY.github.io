I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [the Computer Network Information Center (CNIC)](http://www.cnic.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Hohai University in 2019. My research interests lie in high-performance numerical linear algebra, with a particular focus on heterogeneous computing, parallel and distributed algorithms, and sparse linear solvers for tackling large-scale scientific and engineering problems.
