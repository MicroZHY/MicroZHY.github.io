I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [Computer Network Information Center (CNIC), Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cnic.cas.cn/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Hohai University in 2019. My research interests lie in high-performance numerical linear algebra, with a particular focus on heterogeneous computing, parallel and distributed algorithms, and sparse linear solvers for tackling large-scale scientific and engineering problems.
