I’m a Ph.D. candidate at the [Computer Network Information Center (CNIC)](http://www.cnic.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Professor [Zhonghua Lu](https://www.cnic.cas.cn/sourcedb_cnic_cas/zw/rcdw/yjy/202107/t20210702_6125799.html). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Engineering Mechanics from Hohai University in 2019. I focus my research on high-performance numerical linear algebra, with particular emphasis on heterogeneous computing, parallel and distributed algorithms, and sparse linear solvers to address large-scale scientific and engineering challenges. You can find my [[Resume]](../files/zhanghaoyuan.pdf) here. <span style="color: red;">As I am currently exploring job opportunities, please feel free to contact me if you know of any potential openings.</span>
